# TNP-Limitless-3-Whitelisted-Server
Mods and config files used for our server

Simply copy each subitem (so .jar's, .configs, .etc not Folders themselves) into there respective folder.
The folders are only there to guide where to place the files. BECAUSE BISECTS A BITCH.

If you setup FTP with your server (filezilla or other programs can be used) or have direct access to the servers folder you can simply copy the folders into the main directory after the server has finished updating.
